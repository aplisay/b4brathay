We concluded our last email on 7 February by saying: "We will be seeking clarification as to the current state of play of the Broadband Upgrade Fund (BUF) process and will communicate further when we have some useful information to share."  
  
We have been in touch with B4RN who now have access to some but not, it appears, all of the expressions of interest and supplier preferences on the BUF website.  
  
We believe that in excess of 70 households and businesses from the Skelwith and Little Langdale areas registered and expressed a supplier preference on the BUF website. Yet BARN report downloading only 36 contact records.  
  
Whatever the reason for this shortfall, 32 of the 36 records opted for B4RN as the preferred supplier. So Chris and Paul are now proceeding on the basis that our community has expressed a clear preference for B4RN. We will now discuss the next steps with B4RN (and how to ensure no-one is omitted from future communications).  
  
We are also pleased to report that we now sharing experiences with another broadband community group from Great Langdale led by Sabrina Verjee and Ben Turner. We have already held one Zoom meeting to discuss the best approaches to obtaining wayleaves for cable ducting from the National Trust.  
  
Paul and Chris have also been making contact with various other landowners and "post code champions" in an effort to build a comprehensive picture of who owns what in our area.Â   
  
Best wishes,  
  
Chris and Paul
