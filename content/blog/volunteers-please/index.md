B4RN manage their projects in four stages:

1.  Engage
2.  Plan
3.  Build
4.  Connect

We are now very definitely transitioning to Stage 2 - Plan! Read on for how you can help us ....

Yesterday (Friday 19 March) you may have seen [the news](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-new-5bn-project-gigabit) that government funding has been confirmed for Project Gigabit (as the next phase of the rural broadband roll out will be called). Specifically:

* The new vouchers worth up to £1,500 for residents and up to £3,500 for businesses will go live on 8 April 2021 and mean that rural areas will not have to wait for supplier contracts under Project Gigabit to reach them.
* We understand that matched funding via Digital Borderlands will continue to be available (which effectively doubles the value of the grant per home or business).

So, in short, the value of the scheme is unchanged.

Chris and Paul, with the assistance of various members of the community, have been building a picture of land ownership. This is a prerequisite for the next key stage in the b4brathay Project - acquiring wayleaves for all the land across which the arterial optic fibre routes will pass.

This is a big task and we are now seeking volunteers from the community to help share the load. The sooner the wayleaves are acquired, the sooner the project plan can be submitted to DCMS and the sooner the project funding will be approved.

To find out what is involved we are inviting potential volunteers to a series of online video meetings that will be led by Dan Robinson from B4RN.

Dan has recently been appointed by B4RN as Community Engagement & Development Officer for the b4brathay Project. Dan has an excellent pedigree having previously acted as the community lead on the B4MS (Broadband for the Mint and Sprint) project that brought the B4RN service to several parishes north and east of Kendal.

Please reply to this message if you are interested in finding out more about being a volunteer.

Best wishes,

Paul and Chris
