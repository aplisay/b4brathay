It has taken a little while but we are now all set to get going with B4RN. There are two things you should do right now:

1.  Register your interest in getting B4RN by following[this link](https://b4rn.org.uk/sll) and completing and submitting the form.
2.  If you can print [this flyer](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/971b434a/files/uploaded/Brathay%20Flyer%20v1.2.pdf) then put it through your neighbours' doors.

You need to do the first thing whether you registered on the Broadband Upgrade Fund website or not. Note that this survey does not commit you to anything. Do not be concerned by the title of the survey ("Skelwith and Little Langdale") if you live in Coniston, Great Langdale or other adjacent areas - Paul and Chris will be lobbying for your areas as planning proceeds.  
  
Doing the second thing will improve our community's chance of being successful with our bid for DCMS funding - the more people that sign up, the more grant funding we are likely to get. As well as physically posting the flyer through doors and putting it on notice boards, please also use opportunities to email the PDF file to neighbours or share it via social media (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc).

Best wishes,  
  
Chris and Paul
