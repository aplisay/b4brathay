It is a reasonable question to ask: Won't laying miles of fibre optic cable cause loads of disruption and make a mess of our beautiful bit of countryside?  
  
We hope the videos below, provided courtesy of Dan Robinson and theÂ [B4MS Project](https://b4mintsprint.wordpress.com/), will lay any fears to rest.  
  
Best wishes,
