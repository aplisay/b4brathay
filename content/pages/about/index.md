As of September 2021 the team is:

* Andrew Baxter from Little Langdale
* Rob Pickering from Pull Woods
* James Wilkinson from Little Langdale

As and when things develop we will need to grow the team. If you are interested in acting as a "post code champion" for your bit of the wider Brathay area then please [contact us](/contact).
